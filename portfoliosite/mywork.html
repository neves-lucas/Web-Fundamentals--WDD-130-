        <h2>My work</h2>
		<p>
			From personal websites to show an idea or project to professional business websites, I can turn your thoughts into a place where people can easily access and interact with.

            A business’s online presence, regardless of industry, can have a massive impact on its success. In this day and age, some businesses still don’t realize that a majority of their customers will visit their website before making a purchase.
            Having a strong online presence, particularly a website, can be make or break for generating more revenue.
            I've helped companies of varying sizes create their digital presences. In some cases, organizations are hesitant to get online because they feel they are not tech-savvy enough and don't understand how to manage a website. Other times, companies are concerned about the price. The good news is that there’s a solution out there that will work for you.
		</p>

        <h2>Credibility</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main reasons you should have a website for your business is to increase your organization's credibility. Chances are there are several providers offering a similar service to yours. One way you can stand out is by having a website that looks good and clearly communicates quality information to your consumers. Without a website, people may question your legitimacy as a business. Having a website is an opportunity to make a great first impression and give people comfort that you’re a real business.
        </p>

        <h2>Brand</h2>
        <p>
            Showcasing your brand to your prospective customers is one of the most important things that you can do. By clearly establishing who you are, what you represent and what you stand for, you increase the chances of your customers buying from you. This is also something that can set you apart from your competitors. Without a website, it can be incredibly challenging to do this because people can't easily find quality and reliable information on your business.
        </p>

        <h2>Organic Traffic</h2>
        <p>
            Once you're online and have an SEO-optimized website, you have a chance of showing up in Google search results. This means that when people are searching for a product or service, there is a chance your website will show up in the results. This gives you the opportunity to drastically increase your customer base.
        </p>

        <h2>Saving You Time + Customer Service</h2>
        <p>
            Many businesses get calls from prospects or existing customers asking simple questions about location and hours of operation. If you miss a call, the customer is left unhappy. Calls can also distract your staff from focusing on the most important parts of your business. A website can reduce these calls and increase internal productivity. At the same time, it helps customers find useful information without needing to call, which ultimately provides an all-around better user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Updates And Announcements</h2>
        <p>
            Since your website is on 24/7, it's easy to post updates and announcements to your customers. It's a way to keep them up to date on everything that you're doing. When something is particularly relevant to them, it increases the chance of you being able to upsell them.
        </p>

        <h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
        <p>
            If you plan on leveraging digital marketing to increase your leads and grow your business, you'll likely want to drive traffic to a website or landing page. To do this effectively, leverage historic traffic that has been going to your website so you can target the most qualified customers and get the best ROI on your ad spend. This is something that can’t be set up retroactively, so it is best to get your website running early even if you’re not planning on running ads at the moment.
